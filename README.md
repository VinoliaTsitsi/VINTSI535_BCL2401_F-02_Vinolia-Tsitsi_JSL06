In this coding challenge, I build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal of the project is to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. This challenge helpS you apply various JavaScript concepts, including functions, closures, and event handling, to create an interactive menu.
